Bugs:
- \text
    - trying to test out if crossing out part of expression with the \cancel command is supported
    - this created a \text, doesn't appear to be supported
        - deleting the text it added seemed to put it in a weird state, couldn't move th cusor
        - on example page it shows the latex updating live, this was shown: \text{undefined}
        - also seems to have issues moving from the left into the text after clicking elsewhere


Learning JS Notes:
    - closure - a function that uses the context it was created in to access data
      or other functions
        - in javascript function scope is used for closures, as block scope does
          not exist
    - The global 'Object' is a function (remembvering that functions themselves
      are objects, just as numbers, strings, etc.)
        - Object.prtotype is the the root prototype
        - can 'Object' itself be used as a prototype?

----------------
- brushing up on general JS concepts
- trying to figure out what exactly P.js provides
- debugging directly though the initialization of a mathquill element to
  try to understand what is goin on
- new task
    - acting purely as a consumer of MathQuill, with it as a black box,
      create an interface for editing an equation in a series of steps
    - use the built in MathQuill MathField construct to allow users to
      edit an expression and then hit a button to declare that they are
      moving on to the next 'step'
        - A MathField can easily be created by mathquill-ifying a span 
          with latex in it
    - Should be as simple as starting with a span, adding a button to export
      the latex in the current field and create a new one below it with this
      as the contents
    - put these fields in a div so that the last one can always be found to
      know where to copy from to create the next step
    - bonus
        - create an undo button (not for MathQuill itself, but to delete a step)
            - save the steps in the background to allow re-do
        - put the cursor back where it was
- got a little distracted looking at java projects again
    - it's hard to give up on a prototype, but the java community just isn't as
      active
        - and the editing experience with mathquill is just great
        - and it has lots of tests
        - might decide to go back to the java project someday, but for now I need
          to move on

Work on 1/10/2015
-----------------
- same task as before, make step by step editor by simply copying mathquill fields
- starter task
    - just programmaticlly generate a few MathFields, giving the latex as string
      literals in the JS, adding spans and mathquill-ifying them
        - time estimate 30 mins, complete time 10:30
        - completed, 10:15
    - create a button that will search the div for the last element, export latex from
      it and use it to generate a new mathfield
        - time estimate - 30 minutes, complete time 10:45
        - completed, 10:25
