Bugs:
- \text
    - trying to test out if crossing out part of expression with the \cancel command is supported
    - this created a \text, doesn't appear to be supported
        - deleting the text it added seemed to put it in a weird state, couldn't move th cusor
        - on example page it shows the latex updating live, this was shown: \text{undefined}
        - also seems to have issues moving from the left into the text after clicking elsewhere
